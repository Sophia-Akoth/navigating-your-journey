		<!--Born A Crime-->

			 <p> In the book <b> Born A Crime</b> by Trevor Noah, a young man goes through so many challenges in life but through a supportive mother and acquiring some of the most important attributes in life he is able to defy all odds, overcome all obstacles and emerge a very successful man in this era. The following real life experiences from the book stood out for me and I was able to relate with them.</p>
			<h2>Religion</h2><p>Trevor Noah’s mother and family is very religious, his mom upholds all values that come with religion and she has the will and the determination to impact those values on her son. In the book his childhood involved church. The only time that he had an off was on Mondays and Saturdays. He even mentions that he went to three churches on Sundays.
			I liken my mom to Trevor Noah’s mom when it comes to religion, she does not accept any excuses when it comes to church issues. I always remember one day I pretended to be sick so that I can miss church because I knew that the service would end late and that I would miss my favorite television program.</p><p> I happily conspired a plan to convince my mom hook, line and sinker but what I did not know is that the universe had already conspired against me. My Mother ended up dragging me to church so that the pastor can pray for me and cast out all the demons that are making me sick. She also taught me to listen to that inner voice that gives prior warning or approval before you delve into something. Religious matters brought people together in the book, we could clearly see this by that one time that Trevor Noah decided to attend to his natural call in the house. In this incident people gathered together to pray and drove out the demon, ironically the culprit himself was chosen to pray about the incident.<p/>

 			<h3>Tribalism</h3><p>There is a time Noah’s mom Volkswagen could not start on Sunday, she decided they would use a minibus to go to church. On their way back home they hitch a ride from a Zulu driver who Judges Trevor Noah’s mum based on her tribe which is Xhosa, he almost gets them into an accident, but through her intelligence and quick thinking she is able to devise a plan and she ends up saving her family. In this story tribalism is widely addressed, people are not judged based on their individuality but are judged based on their tribes and all the misconceptions that surround their tribe. Tribes are judged based on factors such as education level, religion, political affiliation. This brings about hatred, lack of unity, division, segregation and it affects the economy of a country in general.There is power in unity,if people come together great things happen.A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.</p>

			<h4>Parental guide and Relationships</h4><p>The other story that stood out for me was how Trevor Noah and his mom used to write letters to one another so as to address their individual grievances. At one time his mom complained about his school marks and how from his actions it was clear that he does not respect his mom and teachers and she ended the letter by telling him that she will ground him and take away all his electronic priviledges.Trevor Noah being the smarty pants that he is, wrote back to his mom  first explaining himself  for getting low marks and even ended up telling his mother that because she did not get very good marks herself and being a product of hers it’s a justifiable reason why he was not getting good marks in that she genetically inherited that factor from  her. From all this instances we can be able to see the good relationship the two had, they had open conversations and they were able to address one another in a peacefully and democratic manner.</p>

			<h5>Conclusions and Findings</h5><p>Reflecting on the above incidences, we are able to see how issues such as religion, tribalism and family relationships affect our day to day lives, decision making and morals. One country is being divided because of different tribal background, the good relationship between mother and son brings about humor and unity in all that they are doing, we are also able to witness the impact of the church in the society.</p>
